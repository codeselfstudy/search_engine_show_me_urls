# Google Show Me URLs

Google stopped showing URLs in the search engine results, making it difficult to understand what you're clicking on. It's hard to find specific sites from a description of the page in the `title` elements.

This browser extension brings URLs back to Google's search results pages so that you can safely see where you're going.
